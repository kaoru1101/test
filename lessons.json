By creating fully immersive digital environments, VR allows visitors to explore art, history, and science in ways that were previously impossible. For example, VR can transport users to ancient civilizations, letting them walk through historical sites or interact with artifacts that no longer exist physically. One key advantage of VR is its ability to enhance accessibility. Individuals with physical disabilities or those living far from cultural institutions can now experience exhibitions from home. VR also provides personalized learning experiences, adapting to different interests and learning styles. However, integrating VR into museums has challenges. The cost of equipment and the need for technical expertise can limit access. There is also the question of whether virtual experiences can replicate the tactile and emotional impact of visiting museums in person. Despite these challenges, VR continues to offer exciting possibilities for the future of museums, making culture and education more accessible and engaging globally.</p><hr><h3>4. 📘 Vocabulary Task</h3><p>Use 2–3 words from the table in sentences, relating to other subjects (history, science, art)</p><table border=1 cellpadding=6><tr><th>Word / Phrase</th><th>Translation / Перевод</th></tr><tr><td>Virtual Reality (VR)</td><td>Виртуальная реальность</td></tr><tr><td>Immersive</td><td>Полное погружение</td></tr><tr><td>Artifact</td><td>Артефакт; предмет культурного или исторического значения</td></tr><tr><td>Accessibility</td><td>Доступность; возможность легкого использования</td></tr><tr><td>Personalized</td><td>Персонализированный; адаптированный под индивидуальные потребности</td></tr><tr><td>Tactile</td><td>Ощутимый на ощупь; тактильный</td></tr><tr><td>Emotional impact</td><td>Эмоциональное воздействие; влияние на чувства</td></tr><tr><td>Exhibition</td><td>Выставка</td></tr><tr><td>Interactive</td><td>Интерактивный</td></tr><tr><td>Simulation</td><td>Симуляция; моделирование</td></tr><tr><td>Cutting-edge technology</td><td>Передовые технологии</td></tr><tr><td>Gamification</td><td>Игровизация; использование игровых элементов</td></tr><tr><td>Learning experience</td><td>Опыт обучения; образовательный опыт</td></tr></table><p><strong>Descriptors:</strong> Applies vocabulary accurately in context.
